# GUI--Coaching-Class
(Coaching Class) Create a class called Coaching that includes four pieces of information as auto implemented propertiesâ€”the coaching type (type string), the number of players (type int), class timings (type string) and charges (type decimal). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four automatic properties and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a method DisplayDetails that displays the coaching type, number of players, class timing and charges (in $) separated by tabs. Write a test app named CoachingTest that demonstrates class Coaching's capabilities.
