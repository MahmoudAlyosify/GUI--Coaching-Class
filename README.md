# GUI-Coaching-Class
(Coaching Class) Create a class called Coaching that includes four pieces of information as auto implemented properties—the coaching type (type string), the number of players (type int), class timings (type string) and charges (type decimal). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four automatic properties and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a method DisplayDetails that displays the coaching type, number of players, class timing and charges (in $) separated by tabs. Write a test app named CoachingTest that demonstrates class Coaching's capabilities.
